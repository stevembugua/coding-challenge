Moringa Coding Challenge Assignment
TITLE:SPEED CHECK.
  DESCRIPTION.
    The second challenge is about checking speed of drivers and validate if its good for the road or not.
  PROJECT SETUP.
    So the max speed one should move at is 70km/h if by any chance the driver exceeds that by an interval of 5km/h he is assigned a point of warning,by say if he gets to     75km/h theres an alert to assign a point to signify warning ,if he gets to 80km/h he is assigned 2points by surpassing the required speed by 10km/h.
    If the driver exceeds a max of 12 points the licence of the certain  driver is suspended due to overspeeding
